A.L.F.R.E.D - Almighty Lightweight Fact Remote Exchange Daemon
--------------------------------------------------------------

"alfred is a user space daemon to efficiently[tm] flood the network with
 useless data - like vis, weather data, network notes, etc"
   - Marek Lindner, 2012

Introduction
------------

alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information over
the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything which
appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv
visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration
information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...

alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert
information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special
programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes
care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other
nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any
configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
information available from all alfred servers in the network.

Compilation
-----------

alfred depends on:
 * librt (usually part of libc)
 * IPv6 support in the kernel/host system

and if distributing GPS information:
 * libgps

To compile alfred, simply type:

 $ make

This will compile alfred, batadv-vis & alfred-gpsd. To install, use

 $ make install

(with the right privileges).

If you don't want to compile batadv-vis, add the directive CONFIG_ALFRED_VIS=n:

 $ make CONFIG_ALFRED_VIS=n 
 $ make CONFIG_ALFRED_VIS=n install

If you don't want to compile alfred-gpsd, add the directive
CONFIG_ALFRED_GPSD=n:

 $ make CONFIG_ALFRED_GPSD=n 
 $ make CONFIG_ALFRED_GPSD=n install


Usage
-----

First, alfred must run as daemon (server) in background to be used. This can
either be done by some init-scripts from your distribution (if you have
received alfred as a package with your distribution). Please see their
documentation how to configure alfred in this case. In any event, you can
still run alfred from the command line. The relevant options are (for a full
list of options, run alfred -h):

  -i, --interface             specify the interface to listen on
  -b                          specify the batman-adv interface configured on
                              the system (default: bat0). use 'none' to disable
                              the batman-adv based best server selection
  -m, --master                start up the daemon in master mode, which
                              accepts data from slaves and synces it with
                              other masters

The -b option is optional, and only needed if you run alfred on a batman-adv
interface not called bat0, or if you don't use batman-adv at all
(use '-b none'). In this case, alfred will still work but will not be able to
find the best next master server based on metrics.

alfred servers may either run as master or slave in the network. Masters will
announce their status via broadcast, so that slaves can find them. Slaves will
then send their data to their nearest master (based on TQ). Masters will
exchange their data (which they have received from slaves or got on their own)
with other masters. By using masters and slaves, overhead can be reduced while
still keeping redundancy (by having multiple masters). Obviously, at least one
master must be present in the network to let any data exchange happen. Also
having all nodes in master mode is possible (for maximum decentrality and
overhead).

To put it together, let us start alfred in master mode on our bridge br0
(assuming that this bridge includes the batman interface bat0):

 $ alfred -i br0 -m

Now that the server is running, let us input some data. This can be done by
using the alfred binary in client mode from the command line:

 $ cat /etc/hostname | alfred -s 64

This will set the hostname as data for datatype 64. Note that 0 - 63 are
reserved (please send us an e-mail if you want to register a datatype), and can
not be used on the commandline. We skipped the version parameter allowing you
to assign a version to your data which can be filtered by other alfred users.
Skipping the parameter entirely has the same effect as setting the parameter
to 0 ('-V 0').

After the hostname has been set on a few alfred hosts, the can be retrieved again:

 $ alfred -r 64
{ "fe:f1:00:00:01:01", "OpenWRT-node-1\x0a" },
{ "fe:f1:00:00:02:01", "OpenWRT-node-2\x0a" },
{ "fe:f1:00:00:03:01", "OpenWRT-node-3\x0a" },

Note that the information must be periodically written again to alfred, otherwise
it will timeout and alfred will forget about it (after 10 minutes).

One final remark on terminology: If we talk about "servers" and "clients" in
alfred, we mean the local processes on one machine which talk to each other via
unix sockets (client connects and talks to servers). On the other hand, "slaves"
and "masters" are the roles alfred can take over in the network between different
machines (slaves send information to masters).

Vis
---

batadv-vis can be used to visualize your batman-adv mesh network. It read the
neighbor information and local client table and distributes this information via
alfred in the network. By gathering this local information, any vis node can get
the whole picture of the network.

batadv-vis, similar to to alfred, combines server (daemon) and client
functionality in the 'batadv-vis' binary. The batadv-vis server must be started
to let batadv-vis work:

 $ batadv-vis -i bat0 -s

This server will read the neighbor and client information from batman-adv every
10 seconds and set it in alfred via unix socket. Obviously, the alfred server
must run too to get this information set.

To get a graphviz-compatible vis output, simply type:
 $ batadv-vis
digraph {
        subgraph "cluster_fe:f0:00:00:04:01" {
                "fe:f0:00:00:04:01"
        }
        "fe:f0:00:00:04:01" -> "fe:f0:00:00:05:01" [label="1.000"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:04:01" -> "fe:f0:00:00:03:01" [label="1.004"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:04:01" -> "00:00:43:05:00:04" [label="TT"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:04:01" -> "fe:f1:00:00:04:01" [label="TT"]
        subgraph "cluster_fe:f0:00:00:02:01" {
                "fe:f0:00:00:02:01"
        }
        "fe:f0:00:00:02:01" -> "fe:f0:00:00:03:01" [label="1.000"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:02:01" -> "fe:f0:00:00:01:01" [label="1.008"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:02:01" -> "fe:f0:00:00:08:01" [label="1.000"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:02:01" -> "fe:f1:00:00:02:01" [label="TT"]
        "fe:f0:00:00:02:01" -> "00:00:43:05:00:02" [label="TT"]
        subgraph "cluster_fe:f0:00:00:08:01" {
                "fe:f0:00:00:08:01"
        }
[...]
}

For a json line formatted output, use:

 $ batadv-vis -f json
{ "primary" : "fe:f0:00:00:04:01" }
{ "router" : "fe:f0:00:00:04:01", "neighbor" : "fe:f0:00:00:05:01", "label" : "1.000" }
{ "router" : "fe:f0:00:00:04:01", "neighbor" : "fe:f0:00:00:03:01", "label" : "1.008" }
{ "router" : "fe:f0:00:00:04:01", "gateway" : "00:00:43:05:00:04", "label" : "TT" }
{ "router" : "fe:f0:00:00:04:01", "gateway" : "fe:f1:00:00:04:01", "label" : "TT" }
{ "primary" : "fe:f0:00:00:02:01" }
{ "router" : "fe:f0:00:00:02:01", "neighbor" : "fe:f0:00:00:03:01", "label" : "1.000" }
{ "router" : "fe:f0:00:00:02:01", "neighbor" : "fe:f0:00:00:01:01", "label" : "1.016" }

Alfred-gpsd
-----------

Alfred-gpsd can be used to distibute GPS location information about
your batman-adv mesh network. This information could be, for example,
combined with Vis to visualize your mesh topology with true geographic
layout. For mobile or nomadic nodes, Alfred-gpsd, can get location
information from gpsd.  Alternatively, a static location can be passed
on the command line, which is useful for static nodes without a GPS.

Alfred-gpsd, similar to to alfred, combines server (daemon) and client
functionality in the 'alfred-gpsd' binary. The alfred-gpsd server must
be started to distribute location information. When retrieving
location information from gpsd, it should be started with:

 $ alfred-gpsd -s

For a static location, use:

 $ alfred-gpsd -s -l 48.858222,2.2945,358

This server will set the location in alfred via unix
socket. Obviously, the alfred server must run too to get this
information set. When using gpsd, it updates alfred every 2
seconds. With a static location, the update it made every 5 minutes.

To get JSON formatted output, use:

 $ alfred-gpsd
[
  { "source" : "f6:00:48:13:d3:1e", "tpv" : {"class":"TPV","tag":"RMC","device":"/dev/ttyACM0","mode":3,"time":"2013-10-01T10:43:20.000Z","ept":0.005,"lat":52.575485000,"lon":-1.339716667,"alt":122.500,"epx":10.199,"epy":15.720,"epv":31.050,"track":0.0000,"speed":0.010,"climb":0.000,"eps":31.44} },
  { "source" : "8e:4c:77:b3:65:b4", "tpv" : {"class":"TPV","device":"command line","time":"2013-10-01T10:43:05.129Z","lat":48.858222,"lon":2.2945,"alt":358.000000,"mode":3} }
